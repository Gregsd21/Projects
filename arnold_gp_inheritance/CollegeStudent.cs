* This class represents a CollegeStudent object, which is derived
* from the Student class by adding the student's major. A constructor
* to set all class and base class properties is provided. ToString 
* is overridden and calls the base class ToString method to get the 
* formatted properties. The GetStudentInformation method is also
* overridden in the same manner.
